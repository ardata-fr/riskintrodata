\description{
Constructs and validates a single row of emission risk factor data for a given country, species, and disease context.
This function serves as a robust helper to generate new entries in the emission risk factors dataset, ensuring
compatibility with subsequent analytical workflows in the \code{riskintroanalysis} package.

The function performs input validation and data cleaning (e.g., coercing numeric fields to integer) and assigns
appropriate data types. It ensures the output meets the schema expected by the emission risk scoring system, which
uses this data to calculate risk scores across four weighted domains:
\itemize{
\item Epidemiological status (e.g., \code{last_outbreak_end_date})
\item Surveillance measures (e.g., \code{disease_notification}, \code{targeted_surveillance}, \code{general_surveillance}, \code{screening})
\item Control measures (e.g., \code{slaughter}, \code{zoning}, \code{official_vaccination})
\item Animal commerce (e.g., \code{commerce_illegal}, \code{commerce_legal})
}

The resulting row includes domain-specific fields that will be used by scoring algorithms such as \code{build_emission_risk_table()}
to derive intermediate and final emission risk values.
